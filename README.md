# BlueScreenOfDeath

A blue screen of death (BSoD), officially known as a stop error or blue screen error,[1] is an error screen that the Windows operating system displays in the event of a fatal system error. It indicates a system crash, in which the operating system has reached a critical condition where it can no longer operate safely, e.g., hardware failure or an unexpected termination of a crucial process.
